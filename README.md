# SciPaWiz: A Tool For Explorative Visualization of Scientific Citation Networks
Project for Data Visualization (2020 fall) course at Aarhus University (Lecturer: Hans-JÃ¶rg Schulz)

The project uses the DBLP and OpenCitations APIs to construct a visual representation of how scientific papers in the field of Computer Science cite each other.

## Demo
The project can be demoed at [kristofferstrube.github.io/SciPaWiz](https://kristofferstrube.github.io/SciPaWiz/) but it is also dependent on external APIs.
The tool is a proof-of-concept. It is recommended to load papers with less than 100 citations due to slow spaghetti code.
