# Scientific Paper Citation Graph Visualization (SciPaCGVis)
Project for Data Visualization (2020 fall) course at Aarhus University (Lecturer: Hans-JÃ¶rg Schulz)

The project uses the DBLP and OpenCitations APIs to construct a visual representation of how scientific papers in the field of Computer Science cite each other.

## Demo
The project can be demoed at [kristofferstrube.github.io/ScientificPaperCitationGraphVisualisation](https://kristofferstrube.github.io/ScientificPaperCitationGraphVisualisation/) but it is also dependent on external APIs.
